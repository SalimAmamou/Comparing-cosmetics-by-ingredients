# Comparing-cosmetics-by-ingredients
Process ingredient lists for cosmetics on Sephora then visualize similarity using t-SNE and Bokeh.
#
the goal is to create a content-based recommendation system where the 'content' will be the chemical components of cosmetics. 
process ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via word embedding,
then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called t-SNE and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh.
#
steps:
1. Cosmetics, chemicals... it's complicated
2. Focus on one product category and one skin type
3. Tokenizing the ingredients
4. Initializing a document-term matrix (DTM)
5. Creating a counter function
6. The Cosmetic-Ingredient matrix!
7. Dimension reduction with t-SNE
8. Let's map the items with Bokeh
9. Adding a hover tool
10. Mapping the cosmetic items
11. Comparing two products
