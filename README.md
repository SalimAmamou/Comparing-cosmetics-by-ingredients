# Comparing-cosmetics-by-ingredients
Process ingredient lists for cosmetics on Sephora then visualize similarity using t-SNE and Bokeh.
#
the goal is to create a content-based recommendation system where the 'content' will be the chemical components of cosmetics. 
process ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via word embedding,
then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called t-SNE and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh.
#
steps:
. Tokenizing the ingredients
. Initializing a document-term matrix (DTM)
. Creating a counter function
. The Cosmetic-Ingredient matrix!
. Dimension reduction with t-SNE
. Let's map the items with Bokeh
. Adding a hover tool
. Mapping the cosmetic items
. Comparing two products
